# HOME-AUTOMATION
This is my 2nd year Mini project.
This project presents a design and prototype of home automation system that uses WiFi technology as a network infrastructure connecting its parts. 
The system works on both hardware and software. 
First is hardware interface module which provides appropriate interface to sensors. 
Second is software which presents system core that controls and monitors users home.
In the prototype we attempt to implement Message Queuing Telemetry Transport(MQTT) on ESP8266, A WiFi based  development board.
